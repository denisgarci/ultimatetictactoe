An Ultimate Tic Tac Toe implementation using Python.
See http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/
for the rules.

This project was created for my Hacker School application.

Just run the ultimate version and enter the coordinates using the following
syntax: x, y

```
1, 2
```

TODO
----

- Exit from anywhere if input == q
- When end game reprompt for a new game
- Improve / re factor the print functions?
- Improves the end game conditions cf some special positions: one victory for each in each row or too much draws
- Multiple type of inputs: comas, space, no separation
